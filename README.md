# We want to learn
This script has the sole purpose to demonstrate the wifi hotspot login process
on some machines (I'm currently running Linux Mint 18.2) for two wifi services.
By using wifi services you imply to agree to their respective terms and conditions. 

1) public:
	- WIFIonICE is the service provided by [DB Bahn](https://bahn.de) in their high speed train 'ICE'

2) private:
	- fritz!box is the private guest service of Fritz!Box routers by [AVM](https://www.avm.de), Berlin

# Please help
There might be some more to come.
This script is a request for comment.
Please help me extend it to more services.

Greetz,
